# HaskToDo
A simple CLI ToDo app. 

## Description
Mostly made as an exercise to get more used to 'real-life' Haskell. But not without its uses

## Getting Started

This has been exclusively made and ran on Linux so dont expect any support for Other Platforms. The software is build using `cabal` so thats a base requirement.

#### Building 

- Clone project `git clone https://github.com/JakobSachs/haskToDo && cd haskToDo` and enter dir
- Build project `cabal build`

### Usage
- The interface is frequent  subject to change so for now , stick to the usage included in the software (`haskToDo help`)

## Authors
